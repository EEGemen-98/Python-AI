# Python-AI
Work in progress, no license

Currently have created a basic pun generator powered by AI. I am using my private beta access to OpenAI's API.

I need to get approval by OpenAI before I can publish this as an app online or license.

This program doesn't work without an API key which is not included.

**punGUI.py change log:**
- created functioning GUI and working OpenAI API outputs (2/23/21)
- organized GUI better and enhanced (2/24/21)
