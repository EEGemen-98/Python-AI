# Python-AI
Work in progress, no license

Currently working on a pun generator powered by gpt-3 AI model (OpenAI). 
I'm planning to do another python app that gives synergy recommendations for the game League of Legends after pun generator is finished and I receive the Riot API key.

I need to get approval by OpenAI before I can publish each program as an app online or license.
These programs don't work without an API key which is not included.

**punGUI.py log:**

 - (Needs Work) GUI needs an organized layout and more labels
 (2/24/2021)
 - (Changes) organized layout a little better and improved AI interaction
 - (Needs Work) Polish GUI and handle empty text input case
