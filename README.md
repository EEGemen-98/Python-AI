# Python-Projects
Work in progress, no license

I very recently learned Python and am using this project for gaining experience developing in Python while having fun with AI at the same time. I started this project 
beginning of Feb 2021.

This program should be treated as example code for a basic Python user interactive program, I am working on iteratively creating more advanced features.

I do plan to evolve this project into something with a more much narrow use and specific purpose, but first I need to get approval by OpenAI before 
I can give public access to API outputs.

This program doesn't work without an API key which is not included. I do not plan on licensing at any point unless I find some scenario
that may be useful to others but at the same time does not violate OpenAI's use case guidelines.
