# Python-AI
No license.

Currently have created a basic pun generator powered by AI. I am using my private beta access to OpenAI's API.

I need to get approval by OpenAI before I can publish this as an app online or license.

This program doesn't work without an API key which is not included.

**How does the pun generator work?**
I designed the app to take input from user on a regular sentence that they would like to create a pun out of. The user writes a sentence in the top box and clicks a button to receive a pun-ified version. The pun-ified version is generated by AI. The "examples.txt" file contains examples used to teach the AI how puns work.

**Why did I make a pun generator?**
I'm not much of a pun enthusiast, but I was curious if AI could demonstrate an understanding of this wordplay. To my surprise, after giving it a few examples (most of the examples listed in 'examples.txt' are actually AI generated) the AI understood how to create puns, some even made me laugh. Now the AI did fail a lot, the AI's success was influenced by the quality of the input sentence. Nonetheless, I observed a clear demonstration of OpenAI's GPT-3 model understanding how puns work.

**punGUI.py change log:**
- created functioning GUI and working OpenAI API outputs (2/23/21)
- organized GUI better and enhanced (2/24/21)
